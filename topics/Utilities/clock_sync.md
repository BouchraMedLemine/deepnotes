## Get RTCs to sync

Here we attempt to use the ubuntu [NTP!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) servers to sync up a target and a host. You can set up your own servers of connect to others too. 

extra tip: Sometimes the Jetson can have issues with the RTC i.e. bad supercap so It's a good idea to leave it for some time after time is set up initially and later check for drift.
